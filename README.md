# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project taught me how to work with jQuery API and Dayjs.

## Usage

When a user clicks into a time block, they can enter an event and save it clicking the save button. The event will be saved in the localStorage.

Go to [Work Day Scheduler](https://armanbarseghyan83.github.io/work-day-scheduler/)
